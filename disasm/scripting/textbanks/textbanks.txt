052d: We won't hide from you{N}anymore.  Ribble has many{N}ancient ruins.{W1}
052e: Men are so selfish.{N}My husband has gone to the{N}east to work.  What about me?{W1}
052f: Keseran is a historian.{N}But Mr. {NAME;11} is smarter{N}than him!{W2}
0530: I saw a strange hollow in a{N}tree.  Does something go{N}there?{W2}
0531: Is what you're looking for in{N}Ribble?{W1}
0532: I can't find it!{W2}
0533: The hidden door to the{N}ancient ruins must be near{N}this tree!{W1}
0534: To Mt. Volcano?{W1}
0535: Go east and then go north{N}along the river.  A cave is{N}there.{W2}
0536: But, I don't recommend you{N}enter such a terrible place!{W1}
0537: We call it the Cave of{N}Darkness.  You can't see{N}anything inside.{W2}
0538: The cave is the only way to{N}get to Mt. Volcano.{W1}
0539: Paseran and I are pupils{N}of Mr. {NAME;11} of Hassan.{W2}
053a: The ancient ruins around here{N}are very interesting to us!{W2}
053b: We're sure there are ruins{N}under Ribble, but we can't{N}find the door?{W2}
053c: I'll find it before Paseran!{N}I think that tree has{N}something to do with it.{W1}
053d: We recently came from Hassan.{N}Hassan is a port in the south.{W2}

0561: They lost his trail at the{N}shore and then split into{N}two groups.{W2}
0562: One group went back to{N}Grans by way of Devil's Tail.{W1}
0563: Hmmm...and what happened{N}to Max?{W1}
0564: He wasn't found in Parmecia,{N}so maybe he went to Grans.{N}I'm not really sure.{W2}

0566: (Sniff)...(sniff)...I smell{N}something old....{W1}

0594: Young men these days are{N}lucky!  I wish I was young{N}again!{W1}

0a81: {LEADER}, I came here{N}to get your Jewel of Evil!{W1}
0a82: Zeon told US to bring it to{N}the Ancient Tower.{N}He didn't mention you.{W2}
0a83: And since we've never heard{N}of you, you're not getting{N}the jewel!{W1}

0ab3: Did he fight against{N}Volcanon at Bedoe?{W1}

0adf: I'm not Volcanon.  I never{N}tell people the future, even{N}if it could prevent death.{W1}
0ae0: Death?!  Not ours I hope.{W1}
0ae1: Zeon is an unimaginably{N}strong devil.{W2}
0ae2: If he attains full power,{N}I, even Volcanon, would not{N}be able to stop him.{W1}
0ae3: So, we have to defeat him{N}before he revives completely.{W1}
0ae4: His power is sealed in the{N}Jewel of Evil.{W1}
0ae5: So, that's why he wants the{N}jewel!{W1}
0ae6: Then, why don't we keep the{N}jewel forever.{W1}

0d3d: Hey, there's {NAME;28}.{W1}
0d3e: I've killed a lot of people{N}for the devils!{W2}
0d3f: The guilt is too much to{N}handle.  I must die!{W1}

0d40: Gee!{N}{NAME;28} killed himself!{W1}
0d41: No, {NAME;28} cannot die{N}by jumping off a cliff.{W2}
0d42: {NAME;28} is an immortal{N}vampire.{W2}
0d43: But, I'm sure the impact{N}didn't feel too good.{W1}
0d44: Ah, devils finally found the{N}hidden door.{W1}
0d45: I must give the people time{N}to escape!{W1}
0d46: The priest pulls out a holy{N}symbol.{W1}
0d47: What's he doing?{W1}
0d48: He's mistaking us for devils.{W1}
0d49: What tough devils!{W2}
0d4a: My symbol doesn't drive{N}them away!{W1}
0d4b: Excuse me, we're not devils.{W1}
0d4c: I don't believe you!{W1}
0d4d: But we really...{W1}
0d4e: Brother?{W1}
0d4f: {NAME;27}, they found the{N}hidden door!{W2}
0d50: I tried to drive them away{N}with this holy symbol, but{N}I failed.{W1}
0d51: Then, they're not devils.{W1}
0d52: Nobody but devils ever come{N}to such a dangerous place!{N}They must be devils!{W1}
0d53: Have you asked them?{W1}
0d54: How can we explain this?{W2}
0d55: We are from Granseal.{N}We came here to defeat the{N}devils.{W1}
0d56: Granseal?{W1}
0d57: Really?{W1}
0d58: Alright!{W1}
0d59: This is great news!{W1}
0d5a: Are you Sir Astral?{W1}
0d5b: Yes, but...I'm sorry, have{N}we met?{W1}
0d5c: I'm {NAME;27}, a son of{N}Hawel.{W2}
0d5d: Do you remember me?{W1}

0d5f: Oh, {NAME;27}!{W2}
0d60: Yes, of course.{N}Nice to see you again.{W2}
0d61: What are you doing here?{W1}
0d62: I came back to Yeel to{N}continue my father's work.{W1}
0d63: {NAME;27}, maybe you can{N}answer some questions?{W1}
0d64: I'll try.{W2}
0d65: What would you like to know?{W1}
0d66: Oh, this will be a great{N}help!{W1}

0d69: I really appreciate this.{W1}
0d6a: I heard you're going to{N}defeat the devils....{W1}
0d6b: Yep.  {LEADER} just{N}solved the secret.  We{N}can now enter the tower.{W1}
0d6c: The tower?{W2}
0d6d: Then, all these disasters{N}were caused by Zeon?{W1}
0d6e: Let me help you.{W1}
0d6f: I would like to give you{N}a hand.{W1}
0d70: Oh, thank you.{W1}
0d71: I appreciate your kindness.{W1}
0d72: ...and now we're here.{W1}
0d73: Wow!  Your story is so{N}complicated.{W2}
0d74: But, from what I understand,{N}Zeon is reviving.{W2}
0d75: And all these disasters were{N}caused by him?{W1}
0d76: That's right.  We have to{N}find out where the Holy{N}Sword is.{W1}
0d77: I think I've seen it in a{N}book....{W2}
0d78: Yes, I did...but...{N}I don't remember....{W1}

0d7c: No, that's not it.{W1}

0d7f: Is that the right one?{W1}

0d80: Yes!  But...{W1}
0d81: But what?{W1}
0d82: The most important part is{N}missing.  It's been stolen.{W1}
0d83: Who could've taken it?{W2}
0d84: Oh, we've lost the key.{W1}
0d85: Not necessarily, Sir Astral.{W2}

0d87: Hmmm....{W2}
0d88: Yes, {NAME;7} is right.{N}{LEADER} is our leader!{W1}
0d89: {LEADER}, we have to{N}find the Holy Sword and{N}the door to the tower.{W2}
0d8a: The legends only hint of{N}you, but we believe in you.{W1}
0d8b: Believe in the power of{N}your jewel!{W1}
0d8c: Yes, that's the truth.{W1}
0d8d: Now, {LEADER}.{W1}
0d8e: We need to return and{N}restore world peace.{W1}
0d8f: {LEADER}, would you mind{N}if I went with you?{W1}
0d90: No, {NAME;27}.  You have{N}to continue your work.{W1}
0d91: I knew you'd say that, but I{N}can't continue my work if{N}Zeon revives.{W2}
0d92: Also, as a historian, I{N}want to see the King of{N}the Devils.{W1}
0d93: {NAME;27} will just follow{N}us if you don't let him{N}join us.{W1}
0d94: {NAME;7} is right.{W1}

0da3: King Galam has not returned{N}from the war against{N}Granseal.{W1}

0da5: He jumped off the top of the{N}castle, but he didn't die!{W1}
0da6: My boyfriend has not{N}returned from the war...{W2}
0da7: I hope he's alive...{W1}
0da8: I heard from a soldier that{N}Yeel is haunted.{W2}
0da9: He said that he heard the{N}sound of a piano playing.{W1}
0daa: From Granseal?  I didn't{N}know anyone survived that{N}earthquake.{W1}
0dab: The priest of Yeel liked the{N}piano.  The ghost may be him.{W1}
0dac: Do you know about the stautue{N}of the devil?  It appeared{N}at the Ancient Tower.{W1}
0dad: Red Baron was looking for{N}something at the Ancient{N}Tower.{W2}
0dae: Nobody returned from that{N}trip.  I didn't go. I was{N}smart!{W1}
0daf: I think he was looking for{N}the Holy Sword.{W2}
0db0: Please don't tell anybody{N}that I told you.{W1}

0db2: Why am I guarding the{N}kitchen?!{W1}
0db3: You want to enter the tower?{W2}
0db4: Impossible.  It's buried in{N}the ground and there is no{N}door.{W1}
0db5: I heard a rumor that a{N}handsome boy is leading{N}the devils now.{W1}
0db6: Good weapons and armor, huh?{W1}
0db7: A statue of a devil's head.{N}It looks ready to bite you.{W1}
0db8: A statue of a fierce{N}devil's head.  There's a{N}slit at its mouth.{W1}

0dd0: Enemies from the sky are{N}mine.  My arrows will get{N}them!{W1}
0dd1: I trained a lot when I was{N}younger.  Style is more{N}important than strength.{W1}
0dd2: I'm not afraid of devils!{N}When's the next battle?{W1}
0dd3: I'll face any devil, any{N}time!  Bring 'em on!!{W1}

0e26: I think he went to Grans{N}Island to operate an ancient{N}vehicle.{W2}
0e27: I've lost my purpose to live.{W1}
0e28: He spent all his spare time{N}studying the Sky Orb.{W2}
0e29: It is quite old.{N}He deduced that our{N}ancestors could fly.{W2}
0e2a: The last known location of{N}the Nazca Ship was Grans.{W1}

0e2d: I came here looking for{N}ancient treasure, and found{N}the Sky Orb.{W2}

0e53: Dark Sol, Dark Dragon and{N}Zeon fought desperately to{N}obtain Arc Valley.{W2}
0e54: The fighting of the devil{N}kings created a mighty storm.{W1}
0e55: Zeon won.  And every devil{N}named him the King of the{N}Devils.{W2}
0e56: The other two kings envied{N}Zeon.  They sealed his powers{N}inside the Jewel of Evil.{W1}
0e57: When Zeon lost his powers,{N}he fell to Earth, and created{N}a giant crater when he hit.{W2}
0e58: His moan destroyed the{N}mountains and the crater{N}was buried by the debris.{W1}
0e59: Grieving over the fight, the{N}God of Wisdom created the{N}Jewel of Light.{W2}
0e5a: The Jewel of Light chose a{N}brave man and gave him a{N}Holy Sword.{W1}
0e5b: With the Holy Sword in{N}hand, the brave man fought{N}against the two devil kings.{W2}
0e5c: The Holy Sword contained{N}holy power.  Thus, the two{N}devil kings were defeated.{W1}
0e5d: Evil Arc Valley was sealed{N}beneath the Ancient Tower.{W2}
0e5e: Never open the door to the{N}tower.  A great evil sleeps{N}inside.{W1}
0e5f: In the event of Zeon{N}awakening, the power of light{N}will choose another.{W2}
0e60: Believe us.  We lie not.{N}Attack the devil at his mouth{N}with the Holy Sword.{W1}
0e61: {LEADER} defeated Red{N}Baron too?  Is that what{N}you said, Geshp?{W1}
0e62: Yes, sir...I'm sorry.{W1}

0e64: Are my soldiers that weak?{W1}
0e65: Yes...oh, no!  I mean, they{N}were strong enough.{W2}
0e66: But {LEADER} and his force{N}were smarter.{W1}
0e67: No more excuses!{W2}
0e68: This is your last chance.{N}Kill {LEADER} this time,{N}or I'll kill you!{W1}
0e69: Ah...yes, sir.  I'll kill{N}{LEADER} this time.{N}I stake my life on it.{W1}

0e6c: You were right, Odd Eye.{W1}

0e6f: If he fails, you must battle{N}{LEADER}.{W1}
0e70: You want me to kill{N}{LEADER}?{W2}
0e71: He's probably much stronger{N}now.{N}Hmmm, sounds interesting.{W2}
0e72: I'll do it.  If this comes{N}to pass, it will be his final{N}battle.{W1}
0e73: {LEADER} is almost here{N}already?{W1}
0e74: Yes, sir.  With an ancient{N}aircraft.  He'll be passing{N}over the cape soon.{W1}
0e75: Good.  I'll do anything to{N}get my powers back.{W1}
0e76: They're stronger than we{N}thought.{W2}
0e77: But, I have an idea.  Please{N}let me try it.{W1}
0e78: Well?{W1}
0e79: I think it's better for us{N}to shoot them down over the{N}
0e7a: cape.{W1}
0e7b: I agree.{W1}
0e7c: Thank you.  Then... may I{W2}
