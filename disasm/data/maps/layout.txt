- 64x64=4096 blocks

Stop when 4096 have been output.

Commands :
- 00 : incremented block value starting from 3
	Apply flags mask as described below.
	
- 01 : count "0" bits until next bit "1" = value length in bits, 
	then value = value + 2^count
	then last bit :
		- 0 = copy section from upper block N times
		- 1 = copy section from left block N times
	No writes in stack maps.

- 1 : 
	customOvr true if 
		- first command
		- or after first line with no values in stack maps for left and upper blocks
		- or next bit = "1" and after first line with no upper stack map value
	customeOvr false if 
		- first block line
		- or after first line with available values in stack maps
		
	if !customOvr and next bit = 0 :
		
		
		1 10 : from up stack
		1 0 : from left stack
		
		11 custom value ?

Flag mask application :
Flag mask applied according to next bits :
	- 00 : no flag set
	- 01 : $C000
	- 100 : $4000
	- 101 : $8000
	- 11 : next 6 bits = flag mask XXXX XX00 0000 0000


2 block history maps : left and upper blocks.
