first 14 bits = number of commands

commands :

00 : copy last output tile
01 : copy following tile from tileset in direction of HFlip.
100 : copy mapped tile from right tile history map
101 : copy mapped tile from bottom tile history map
110 : same as 111 but with same flags as previous output tile (high priority, VFlip and HFlip)
111 : output value and update right/bottom tile maps. 
	First 3 bits = High priority, VFlip and HFlip flags
	Next bit defines offset mode : 
		0 = relative to previous output tile :
			- 5 bits for value
			- 1 bit for sign
		1 = absolute (9 bits + 1 optional bit)
			If value >= $180, then value = value * 2 - $180 + next bit
