Background format :

[tileset1 offset][tileset 2 offset][palette offset][palette][tileset 1][tileset 2]

Tileset 1 offset : relative offset of tileset 1 data, from current position. Always $0026 in practice, as following data is always the same size (2 offsets and 1 palette).
Tileset 2 offset : relative offset of tileset 2 data, from current position.
Palette offset : relative offset of background palette. Always $0002 in practice, as the palette is always stored just next to the offset, apparently.
Palette : standard 16-color palette
Tilesets 1 and 2 : graphics data using the stack compression algorithm.

Theoretically, data can be stored in any order, but in practice they're always stored in following order : palette, tileset 1, tileset 2. 
Hence the fixed values for 1st and 3rd offsets.
